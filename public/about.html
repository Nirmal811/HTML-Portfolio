<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Kanumetta Nirmal Ramanujam, currently pursuing my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, with an expected graduation in 2025. My academic journey has been driven by a passion for problem-solving and analytical thinking, as reflected in my achievements in competitive exams like JEE Advanced, where I ranked among the top 3.74% of candidates. I have always excelled academically, from securing a gold medal for scoring among the top 0.1% in CBSE Mathematics to achieving consistent excellence in my higher secondary education.</p>

<p>Professionally, I have cultivated a strong skill set through hands-on experiences in data science and business analytics. During my time at Finlatics, I tackled real-world problems such as analyzing profitability models, developing Power BI dashboards, and conducting exploratory data analysis on large datasets. My projects, ranging from loan prediction systems to COVID-19 data visualization, allowed me to apply machine learning techniques, advanced visualizations, and statistical modeling, showcasing my proficiency in Python, C++, and tools like Power BI.</p>

<p>Beyond academics and professional growth, I actively contribute to my community and campus. As a mentor, I guide first-year students in navigating their academic and personal goals, and as a coordinator for events like Nova Saarang, I embrace creativity and teamwork. My interests extend to playing chess, participating in national quizzes, and engaging in NCC activities, which have enriched my strategic thinking and leadership skills. I am committed to leveraging my skills and experiences to create meaningful impact wherever I go.</p>
